        David Goggins is an American ultramarathon runner, ultra-distance
        cyclist, triathlete, motivational speaker, and author, renowned for his
        mental toughness and endurance. Born on February 17, 1975, he overcame a
        challenging childhood marked by abuse, poverty, and discrimination.
        Struggling with obesity and low self-esteem, Goggins transformed his
        life by losing over 100 pounds in three months to join the U.S. Navy
        SEALs, an extraordinary testament to his willpower.

        In the military, Goggins distinguished himself by completing Hell Week
        three times and serving as an Air Force Tactical Air Control Party
        member. His military experiences forged his mental and physical
        endurance, which he later applied to endurance sports. He has excelled
        in ultramarathons, including the notoriously difficult Badwater 135,
        ultra-distance cycling, and triathlons. Goggins' philosophy is centered
        on the "40% rule," which suggests that when one thinks they are done,
        they are only 40% done. This mindset is detailed in his memoir, "Can't
        Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds," which has inspired
        millions to overcome their obstacles and strive for greatness. As a
        motivational speaker, Goggins encourages audiences to embrace
        discomfort, push past limits, and cultivate resilience. David Goggins
        exemplifies perseverance and mental fortitude, transforming from a
        troubled youth into a symbol of endurance and inspiration. His story
        demonstrates the power of determination and hard work, inspiring
        countless individuals to pursue their potential against all odds.
